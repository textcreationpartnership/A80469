         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the firſt Article thereof being long debated, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by Vote in the Affirmative; <hi>viz. That all Souldiers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they be not ſervants or beggers, ought to have voyces in electing thoſe which ſhall repreſent them in Parliament, although they have not fortie ſhillings in the yeare, by free-hold Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:161274:2"/>
            <p>And there were but three voyces againſt this your native free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. After this they would referre all to a Committee, and the next <hi>Generall Councell</hi> our friends obtained a <hi>generall Randezvouz,</hi> and a <hi>Letter from the Councell to cleare the Armie from any deſire or intent of conſtraining the Parliament to ſend new Propoſitions to the King,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your indemnitie for fighting againſt the King, ſhould be begged of the King, <hi>and ſo the gilt of innocent bloud laid upon your owne beads,</hi> and your enemies ſhall boaſt and inſult over you, ſaying, <hi>You were forced to aske them to ſave you harmleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the next meeting <hi>a Declaration</hi> was offered to the Councell, wherein the Kings corrupt intereſt was ſo intermixed, that in a ſhort time, if he ſhould ſo come in, he would be in a capacitie to deſtroy you, and the people; and aſſure your ſelves, if any power be in the leaſt given to him, he will improve it to the utmoſt to inſlave and ruine you that conquered him, and to advance your enemies to trample upon you. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this wee deſired onely a free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of this Queſtion; Whether it were ſafe, either for the Armie, or the people, to ſuffer any power to be given to the King:</hi> and Lievtenant Generall <hi>Crumwell,</hi> and the reſt, profeſſed as before God, they would freely debate it; and munday laſt, a generall Councell was appointed for that purpoſe; but when they met they wholly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in ſtead of that ſpake very reproachfully of us and our Actions, and declared againſt that which was paſt the Councell before, <hi>Concerning the voyces of thoſe in Election, which have not fortie ſhillings by the yeare free-hold, and againſt the Letter ſent by the Councell to the Parliament,</hi> and the day before Commiſſary Generall <hi>Ireton</hi> withdrew and proteſted he would act no more with them, unleſſe they recalled the Letter, and to prevent any further <hi>debate, they would have diſſolved the Councell for above a fortnight;</hi> and thus our hopes of agreeing together to ſettle your and the peoples freedoms were then fruſtrated, and though the chiefe of them had deſired ſome of our friends, not above three dayes before to goe on in their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>for they might come in when they ſhould doe us more ſervice then at that time,</hi> yet then they made great outcries againſt us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of diſtempers in the Armie, which were nothing <hi>but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after their rights and freedoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day they ſtill waved and refuſed the free debate of the aforeſaid Queſtion, and diſſolved this Councel for above a fortnight; and for a time reſolved they would only prepare ſome faire <hi>Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:161274:2"/>to the Army, and about Arrears and pay, and ſent to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a moneths pay againſt a Randezvourz; <hi>But they declared they would divide the Army into three parts,</hi> to Randezvouz ſeverally; and all this appeares to be only to draw off the Army from joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſettle thoſe cleere foundations of Freedome propounded to you, &amp; to procure your rights as you are Souldiers effectually, without any more deluſions. Thus you may obſerve the ſtrange unconſtancy of thoſe who would obſtruct your wayes, <hi>and the great matter wherein the difference lyes,</hi> and the candidneſs of our actings, but we hope it will be no diſcouragement unto you, though your Officers, yea, the greateſt Officers, ſhould apoſtatiſe from you; Its well known that the great Officers which now oppoſe, did as much oppoſe ſecretly when wee refuſed to disband according to the Parliaments Order; and at laſt <hi>they confeſſed the Providence of God was the more wonderfull; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe reſolutions to ſtand for Fredom and juſtice began among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers only.</hi> And yet now they would affright you from ſuch actings, by telling you, its diſobedience to the Generalls commands, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
